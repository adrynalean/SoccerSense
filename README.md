SoccerSense is a comprehensive football analysis system that leverages machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning to extract meaningful insights from football match videos. Whether you're a beginner looking to get started with computer vision or an experienced engineer aiming to explore advanced techniques, SoccerSense offers a hands-on experience with state-of-the-art tools and methodologies.

## Overview

In this project, you will learn how to:

1. **Detect Objects with YOLOv8**: Utilize Ultralytics YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detector, to detect players, referees, and footballs in images and videos.
2. **Train Custom Object Detectors**: Fine-tune and train your own YOLO model on a custom dataset to enhance detection accuracy.
3. **Segment Players by T-Shirt Color**: Use KMeans clustering for pixel segmentation to accurately assign players to teams based on their t-shirt colors.
4. **Track Camera Movement**: Implement optical flow techniques to measure camera movement between frames, crucial for accurate player tracking.
5. **Perspective Transformation**: Apply OpenCV's perspective transformation to represent the scene's depth and perspective, allowing you to measure player movement in meters rather than pixels.
6. **Calculate Speed and Distance**: Measure players' speed and the distance covered on the field using advanced tracking techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **`models/`**: Pre-trained models and custom-trained YOLO models.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step guides on implementing each component of the project.
